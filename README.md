### Set it, and forget it
With Course Sync, you won't need to struggle with non-functioning reaction roles or updating them every time you join new server.
Input your courses, and we'll do the rest 🍵

This bot is fully-equipped with auto course-sync capabilities, allowing you to declare your classes, and it will seamlessly sync them across every server that utilizes this bot.
With easy-to-use menus, and a simple user-friendly interface, Course Sync allows for easy setup, both on the student's side and the community manager.

This service allows for multiple servers across NMSU* Discord servers to be fully interconnected, and network with each other by allowing easy, automatic assignment of class roles, creation of class chats, and syncronization across multiple servers!
This will allow for new or existing servers to provide channels for certain departments, or even all depending on who joins. The bot does all the heavy lifting, all you have to do is declare which classes you are taking this semester, and the bot will take care of the rest!

## 🎀 A Little More About Me 
- 🌱 I am currently learning Node.js, and continuing my studies on data structures and algorithms.
- 🪴 I am interested in creating front- and back-end solutions for startups, and create a story-heavy video game.
- 🔮 Away from code, I love to watch movies in my free time and fall down a rabbit hole of murder mysteries.
- 🎬 Disney is my obsession, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
